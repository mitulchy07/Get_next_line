    Reading Lines: The program reads lines from both files one by one, printing each line along with which file it came from. After printing, the line is freed. Stopping Condition: The loop continues until both files reach EOF (end-of-file). File Closure: After reading all lines, both files are closed. If you want to alternate between the two files line-by-line, you can modify the logic to check if a line is available for one file before switching to the other.
